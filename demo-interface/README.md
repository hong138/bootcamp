- JAVA APIE: Abstraction (Interface), Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
### Interface (100% Abstraction) vs Inheritance (extends Parent Class)
- Differences:
  - No Attribute vs have attribute(s)
  - No Constructor vs have Constructor(s)
  - Implements >= 1 Interface vs Extends ONLY 1 Parent Class
  - Methods are all abstract (before Java 8) vs Contains both abstract & concrete method
  - Not support static variable vs Support...
- Same:
  - Support Static Final Variable
  - Support Static method (After Java 8)
  - Support Default/Inherit instance method (After Java 8)
